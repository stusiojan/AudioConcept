# GZTAN genre CNN classificator

Based on [mamodrzejewski GTZAN genre classification example](https://github.com/mamodrzejewski/wimu-gtzan-genre-example), which is based on [Music Classification: Beyond Supervised Learning, Towards Real-world Applications](https://music-classification.github.io/tutorial/part3_supervised/tutorial.html) by Minz Won, Janne Spijkervet and Keunwoo Choi.

I am using a machine with apple sillicon, so the code will be modified to run well on ARM architecture.

In this project we are using wandb for experiments monitoring, so this will be changed from tensorboard.

# Run

```bash

```
