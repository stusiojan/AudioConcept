## SETUP

#### Prepare virtual environment and download dependencies
```bash
python 3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

--------

Log in to Weights and biases
```bash
wandb login
# paste your API key from website https://wandb.ai/home
```

## USAGE

To train and predict use commands:
```bash
python -m AudioConcept.modeling.train
python -m AudioConcept.modeling.predict
python -m AudioConcept.plots
```
